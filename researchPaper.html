    <p> Apple’s design language </p>
 
 
<br> <br> Throughout the years, the language in which website interfaces display their information to users has changed dramatically. Websites used to implement many “3D buttons”, shadows, different fonts, they also used bubbles for everything (from simple navigation buttons to new announcements). In this analysis, Apple’s changes in its website and the philosophy behind it is going to be discussed.
 
<br> <br>By using the Internet Archive, you can access any website’s history as long as there’s a snapshot of said website on said date. The Internet Archive uses an automated software program that visits as much sites as it’s capable of and copies the material to a server at the organization and organizes it by date. The software is called a “web crawler”. Some “web crawlers” are designed to index the material at the site for use in search engines or special purpose databases and will process and store the information in different ways.
 
 <br> <br> In order to study and analyze the design of Apple’s site, we have divided it into 3 stages, spanning 22 years, from 1997 up to 2019. The stages are going to be evaluated and compared based on the navigation bar, font, buttons, colors, and the usage of ads. These differences or “improvements” In general, can be applied on most if not all sites that had a prolonged footprint on the World Wide Web.   
 
<br> <br>Beginning in 1996, the Apple site was as hectic as it has ever been. The navigation bar was a wide red rectangle on the left-hand side of the site, with an unclear blurry font. The hyperlinks are in blue and underlined. All headings have the same font and the paragraphs share a unified font too. The buttons were designed to appear 3D, with highlights on the top left and shadows on the opposite side. Apple used a white background on the site with red accents. they have also implemented ads on their site (right under their logo) such as BMW and the EMATE 300. Overall, just lacking a clean-cut design such as most websites at the time.
            
<br> <br>Around 10 years later, we can see that apple’s site has transitioned to a more clean and polished site. It still kept its white background while removing the red navigation bar and the red accents. The navigation bar was repositioned to the top as it has become sleeker with the buttons popping up, creating the illusion of them being three-dimensional. The fonts differed and added a touch of diversity to the site, the fonts were between black, gray, white, and blue. In this version of this website, Apple ditched the usage of ads from different companies, as they only advertised the companies that are partnered with Apple (such as Nike).
 
<br> <br> 10 more years and we arrive to the current version of Apple.com, the background is still white, but the entire format has differed. The site now consists of multiple vertically arranged sleek boxes that have a very light shade of gray as a background. Each one of these flat boxes displays Apple’s newest devices and promotions. With a steady and predictable format, each box has a heading in a large black font, some description with a smaller lighter black font, and then one or two hyperlinks that are in a shade of royal blue. The navigation has now become flat and is in a dark gray background with white text, it’s also a fixed navigation bar (so when you scroll it still stays still) all types of 3D effects were removed; giving the site a cleaner, sleeker, easier on the eye, and more modernized look.
            
<br> <br> Each and every one of these changes has its own reasons behind it, humans have been evolving and preferring more simplistic and sleek designs on a yearly basis. It looks more futuristic and smooth, which is kind of ironic; as in the early years of GUI design, everyone was trying to add special effects and make things float and seem three-dimensional. But it turns out, people actually prefer the more simplistic two-dimensional look. And the path in which Apple traversed, flawlessly demonstrated people’s perception as to what they want to see on a site.

<br> <br> Overall the aesthetics of apple’s website and user interface have been a key to its successes. When looking at Apple's website, psychologically we find certain things to be appleing. It's easy formatting and simple design is something that draws people in. According to Amber Leigh Turner in TWN, “Keeping things simple with a well-organized website using adequate white space tells visitors you know what’s important and you don’t want to waste their time.”(The Next Web, DESIGN & DEV, 24 July 2018). This is something that Apple really utilizes in their webpages, starting with their 1996 webpage all the way to their 2019 webpage. Psychologically the colors and patterns that apple implements in their website are aesthetically pleasing to the user. They use bright colors that are extremely heightened by the contrasting background colors of white and in some cases black. Things like tabs and links, which lead to other webpages have a psychological impact on us because we feel as if where in control of the webpage. We feel as if that webpage was specified to my individual needs, thus making the users visit enjoyable.

<br> <br> Since 1995, Apple has changed dramatically. Apple's first website was published in 1997, and the website looked like a newsletter more than a website. Their website even have an option to register or a free CD-ROM. It talks about pre ordering a Mac OS8, and gives information on being able to qualify to vin a Power Book 3400/200. Flash forward 5 years, the website has changed in many ways, at the top of the screen you’re able to choose a tab and it’ll open the page up to you, it advertises at the time, the world's fastest computer, The Power Mac G5. Within the next 5 years, Apples website promotes iPhones, iPod touches and newer versions of the Mac. In 2013, the website became more visual and caught the attention of many people with the newest iPads, iPad mini’s, iMacs and iPhones with new pictures of all these devices. From 1998-2018 Apple’s website went from having very bland and very plain basic pictures, just a computer or a couple of iPhones to now showing their products with more colors and the features the products have. The website now has global navigation, a footer na vgigation, a main promo, and four secondary promos. The 2019 website had multiple promos, and even showed how much they started off as. The website lets you scroll up and down to see all the products and even gives you an option to learn more information about them. It even lets you click the picture to see the product, gives you the option to zoom into the product for closer detail. The website overall has changed drastically, from not being able to scroll to being able to scroll and view products and their information. 

 <br> <br> Over the years, since 1995, apple has taken its marketing to a whole nother level, one that has made historical records annually and has changed the culture of our society. Apple Inc. has made tremendous revenue since it first came out with the iPhone 3, or the iPhone 3rd generation. With the annual advancement and upgrade Apple made to all of its products, Apple has made over half of its revenue from selling the iPhone alone and every upgraded version there after. In the 2000’s, Apple installed the ability to shop online via its webpage, apple.com. To their advantage, it brought it higher revenue and made it quicker to shop while searching for product on their webpage. This installment of the shop and delivery allowed not just individual residents to order, but for organizations and institutions to order large products to their door. In the beginning, revenue was slow. The new installment of the shop online brought a new aspect to Apple’s ability to make money. The website had more views, increasing drastically every year due to the new online shopping piece and brought the attention to other online shopping stores as well, which include Ebay and Amazon and others. The online shopping aspect of the website allowed other online shopping services to buy and sell their products via online. Apple had just come out with the website and it began to change the face of its business. Apple’s most recent online shopping and services made about 12 billion dollars, which is one-fifth of the total revenue made for Apple. The most recent Apple products, such as the iWatch and Apple Apps, made a huge seller in most recent years, also including products such as the Airpods, Airpods second generation, and other useful tools that come in handy when using their big products (laptops, phones, etc.). The website includes, always, all of their newest products, and advertises them with sells and discounts and more. These aspects to the new and most recent Apple website helped the company as a whole sell their products and bring attention to all the new things Apple has to offer at a yearly and monthly basis.
